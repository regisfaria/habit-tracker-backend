# Habit - Server

## Overview

I'm developing an app in which will be an habit tracker. This project is responsible for it's server.

For now, this project is meant for one person to use, meaning that we don't have any authentication nor user differentiation.

You will be able to create habits, mark them as completed and also retrieve habit information on a day or as a summary.

## Installation & Running

You will need nodejs LTS version and npm.

Simply run `> npm i`

After installed, make sure you copy the file called `.env.example` into a file called `.env`

Now you're ready to start! Run the API with: `> npm run dev`.

Server will be listening in port `3333`. Make sure it's available.
